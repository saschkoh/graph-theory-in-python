# dijkstra-algorithm-in-python

This is a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in a graph. It allows to read graphs from .gra-files and calculate the shortest distances from a target node to all other nodes using backward differences or find the shortest path of a source node to a target node either with unmodified or modified edge weights for better performance.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
