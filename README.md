# graph-theory-in-python

This is a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in a graph. It allows to read graphs from .gra-files and calculate the shortest distances from a target node to all other nodes using backward differences or find the shortest path of a source node to a target node either with unmodified or modified edge weights for better performance.

The project was an assignment in the course "Operations Research" at Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Technik (BHT) in Department II, lectured by Prof. Martin Oellrich. To read and handle graphs, a [generic graph class](https://github.com/saschkoh/oellrich-graph-in-python) in Python based on the C++ implementation of Prof. Oellrich is being used.

The future plan is to expand the package with further graph exploration methods and add visualization methods.

## Installation
Git is needed to install the requirements.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python dijkstra <input_file_path>.gra -t <target_name>  # backward distances
python dijkstra <input_file_path>.gra -s <source_name> -t <target_name>  # unmodified
```

### Options
Only if both source and target node are given:
- `-m, --modified` Use modified edge weights for better runtime.
- `-i, --iter` Print iterations needed to console.
- `-pr, --predecessors` Print predecessors list to console.
- `-pa, --path` Print shortest path to console.
  
### Run Unit Tests
```bash
cd graph-theory-in-python
python -m unittest test.test_dijkstra
```
